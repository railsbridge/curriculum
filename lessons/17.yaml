goal_title: Redirect to the topics list after creating a new topic
goal: |
  
  When a user creates a new topic they are currently shown a page with
  just that topic. For our voting app it makes more sense that they
  would be taken back to the topic list.
  
  In this step we'll change the flow of our app so that the user is
  taken back to the topics list after they add a new topic.

steps: |
  
  Open `app/controllers/topics_controller.rb` and look at the create
  method (it looks like this):
  
  <pre class="code">
  :::ruby
  def create
    @topic = Topic.new(params[:topic])

    respond_to do |format|
      if @topic.save
        format.html { redirect_to @topic, :notice => 'Topic was successfully created.' }
        format.json { render :json => @topic, :status => :created, :location => @topic }
      else
        format.html { render :action => "new" }
        format.json { render :json => @topic.errors, :status => :unprocessable_entity }
      end
    end
  end
  </pre>
  
  Change the line:

  <pre class="code">
  :::ruby
  format.html { redirect_to @topic, :notice => 'Topic was successfully created.' }
  </pre>

  so that the file looks like this:
  
  <pre class="code">
  :::ruby
  def create
    @topic = Topic.new(params[:topic])

    respond_to do |format|
      if @topic.save
        format.html { redirect_to topics_path, :notice => 'Topic was successfully created.' }
        format.json { render :json => @topic, :status => :created, :location => @topic }
      else
        format.html { render :action => "new" }
        format.json { render :json => @topic.errors, :status => :unprocessable_entity }
      end
    end
  end
  </pre>
  
  Look at it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

explanation: |
  
  * `format.html { redirect_to topics_path, :notice => 'Topic was successfully created.' }`:
    * `format.html` means that the server should send html back to the browser
    * `redirect_to topics_path` means show the topics list page when we're done creating a topic
    * `:notice => 'Topic was successfully created.'` puts the message into the flash so it will be displayed on the topics list
