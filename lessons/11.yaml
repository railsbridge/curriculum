goal_title: Commit and push to heroku
goal: |
  
  We just added a whole new feature. Let's push it to heroku so our
  friends can play with it. In order to do so, we need to make a
  small change to our `Gemfile`

steps: |
  
  Open the file called `Gemfile` in KomodoEdit, or your preferred editor
  and find the line beginning:
  
      gem 'sqlite3'
  
  Remove this line and replace it with:
  
      group :development do
        gem 'sqlite3'
      end
  
      group :production do
        gem 'pg'
      end
  
  In your terminal, try: (**note:** there is a period after the word
  add in the first line)
  
      $ git add .
      $ git commit -m "Added topics"
      $ git push heroku master
      $ heroku rake db:migrate

explanation: |
  
  * The Gemfile is a list of all the Ruby libraries your application needs.
    what we've declared here, is that we want to use the `sqlite3` library
    while we're developing on our computer (the development group) but when
    deploying to heroku (the production group) we want to use the `pg` library,
    which is made for the type of database that Heroku uses.
  * We've done the first three steps before, so we won't go over that again...
  * `heroku rake` executes a rake task on your server, in this case,
    `db:migrate`, just like you did locally.
