  ## Other Tools to help you learn Ruby

  ### ri

  ri is a tool to look up ruby documentation:

      $ ri String.split
      = String.split

      (from ruby core)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        str.split(pattern=$;, [limit])   => anArray

      ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Divides str into substrings based on a delimiter, returning an array of
      these substrings.
      ...

  You can do a lot with it:

  * `ri Class` -- looks up the class documentation and shows all the methods available.
  * `ri Class.method` -- looks up a specific method on a class or module.
  * `ri method` -- searches all classes for matching methods

  If running ri doesn't work and you've installed ruby using rvm, try
  running this command first:

      $ rvm docs generate

  ### irb

  We've already introduced irb above, but it can't be stressed enough
  that having an interactive live session with ruby is invaluable. You
  can learn a lot from it.

  Add this to a file called ~/.irbrc:

  <pre class="code">
  :::ruby
  class Object
    def pim inherited = false
      self.class.public_instance_methods(inherited).sort -
        Object.public_instance_methods
    end
  end
  </pre>

  Now you can do stuff like:

      $ irb
      >> "blah".pim
      => ["%", "*", "+", "<<", "<=>", "[]", "[]=", "bytes", "bytesize", ...]

  All of these methods are available for any string. You can then use
  `ri` to look up the method documentation. It is a great way to find goodies!
